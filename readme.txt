I. Changes to the group

==> This student has left his old group and done the assignment alone in a new group number.
    Thus, the project plan, software design document, and Gantt chart will be similar to - 
    his former teammate. 

II. Changes to documents in part A assignment

==> This student has made a little changes to: 
	- Project plan: The changing detail is mentioned in the document
	- Gantt	Chart: it was changed to match the Project plan
	- Software design document: an informal report about the changes was created; please 
	  check the file called: Report of Change.docx

II. Running Environment and minor issues

==> Mac: the messagebox library in TKinter is not compatible with Mac machine. Thus, it will yield a warning each time we called the messagebox library function (function still works, but we will receive a warning). It is recommended to run this software on a Mac machine.

==> Window: since this software was built on a Mac machine, if we run it on a Window machine,
the buttons might be overlapping.
